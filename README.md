# Emotion-Prediction-using-RNN-and-LSTM
In this project we tried to improve the results for the problem statement of Emotion Prediction using RNN and LSTM 
by applying a Dimensionality reduction technique called PCA and compared the preformance of models before applying 
PCA and after applying PCA 
# NOTE :
The Results of RNN without PCA are not correctly available due to the errorful file getting saved during
the training proces, but due to lack of high end GPU for training purposes , we couldn't re-train the model.
So in future if anyone wishes to publish the results , the individual may use the very same code by changing the 
name of the GPU device used in the notebook to their respective name .
